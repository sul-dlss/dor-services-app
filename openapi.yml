      description: >
        Unique identifier in some other system. This is because a large proportion of what is deposited in SDR,
        historically and currently, are representations of objects that are also represented in other systems.
        For example, digitized paper and A/V collections have physical manifestations, and those physical objects are managed
        in systems that have their own identifiers. Similarly, books have barcodes, archival materials have collection numbers
        and physical locations, etc. The sourceId allows determining if an item has been deposited before and where to
        look for the original item if you're looking at its SDR representation. The format is: "namespace:identifier"
